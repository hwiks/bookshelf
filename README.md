# bookshelf

This is a project to self-teach me Java. The ultimate goal is to have an app (I am learning Android Studio in parallel) that my mom can use to keep track of her extensive library, from which she often borrows books to people.

For now, I have a GUI with some working buttons, and a way to store the data.
